### Lending Services Killer<br>

The aim of the project is to create a decentralized analogue of the promissory note.<br>

## Fiat definitions
From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promissorynote.asp):
>A promissory note is a debt instrument that contains a written promise by one party (the note's issuer or maker) to pay another party (the note's payee) a definite sum of money, either on-demand or at a specified future date. A promissory note typically contains all the terms pertaining to the indebtedness, such as the principal amount, interest rate, maturity date, date and place of issuance, and issuer's signature.<br>
>Although financial institutions may issue them—for instance, you might be required to sign a promissory note in order to take out a small personal loan—promissory notes **usually allow companies and individuals to get financing from a source other than a bank**. This source can be an individual or a company willing to carry the note (and provide the financing) under the agreed-upon terms. In effect, promissory notes can enable anyone to be a lender.<br>

In the fiat world, the circulation of promissory notes is regulated by the [UNIFIED LAW ON BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND PROMISSORY NOTES](https://github.com/binomfx/uPRON/blob/main/UNIFORM_LAW_FOR_BILLS_OF_EXCHANGE_AND_PROMISSORY_NOTES).<br>

## Decentralized Features
Обеспечение векселя - коллатерал
Срок погашения - экспирация
Индосамент - блокчейн. !!! можно ли сделать солидарную ответственность все, через чьи руки прошел вексель?

## Synt Idea
Создать синтетический токен, функционирующих аналогично простому векселю, обеспеченный токенами UNISX. 
Срок инструмента соответствует сроку погашения векселя.
Цена синтетического токена привязана к дисконту и по мере приближения срока погашения приближается к стоимости обеспечения.
