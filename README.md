# uPRON - Synthetic Promissory Notes
The aim of the project is to create a decentralized analogue of the promissory note.<br>
In the fiat world, the circulation of promissory notes is regulated by the [UNIFIED LAW ON BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND PROMISSORY NOTES](https://github.com/binomfx/uPRON/blob/main/UNIFORM_LAW_FOR_BILLS_OF_EXCHANGE_AND_PROMISSORY_NOTES)

The important parameters of the promissory note are listed in the following quote from the [UNIFIED LAW ON BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND PROMISSORY NOTES](https://github.com/binomfx/uPRON/blob/main/UNIFORM_LAW_FOR_BILLS_OF_EXCHANGE_AND_PROMISSORY_NOTES):
